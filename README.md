# silverlight-selenium
 Silverlight-selenium extends the Selenium RC clients for adding SilverLight Communication Capabilities

This was intended as a communication bridge between selenium rc and silverlight controls via scripting.
The idea was to expose silverlight stuff making them scriptable and then accessing them from js.
This required to actually modify the AUT in order to mark classes/methods as scriptable.
